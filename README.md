Placeholders for the three popular vanish plugins.

# Requirements
* Vanish plugin (Vanish No Packet, SuperVanish/PremiumVanish, or Essentials/EssentialsX)
* Placeholder API

# Usage
* `%vanish_count%` - an integer returning the amount of vanished players. It accounts for not being able to see different groups.

* `%vanish_vanished%` - a boolean primarily implemented for scripting purposes that use PAPI
